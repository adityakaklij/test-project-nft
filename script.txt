Hi Adam,
It's great to connect with you

I came across your profile and was genuinely impressed by your background
Your background looks like a great fit for our project.

Can we talk more about the opportunity?

Thanks

************************

Let me explain about that

Currently We're planning to develop the NFT Marketplace project.

The current ongoing project has only developed the UI, so there are many parts that do not work.

So we're trying to improve the UI of the project first.

As the urgent project, we're going to hire several developers for this project and start the work next month.

May we share you the ongoing project?
Then, you can get a better idea about our project.
let me know what part of this project you take on.


If I send you a test project, you can send me a Loom video or GitHub link with the test results after you complete the test within a day at least.

pls select one.

********************
Sorry, due to company security issues I can't share it on github.
I send you zip code
